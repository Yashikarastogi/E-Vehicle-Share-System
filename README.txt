Running the application is relatively easy and require only a few steps.

1. Open the anaconda prompt and move to the project folder directory where the readme is located .
2. Run in the anaconda prompt "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the required python packages
4. For proper UI visualisation, make sure to set the display settings to scale 100% and Display resolution to 1920x1080, as it may look weird for high resolution displays.
3. Run the application with "py main.py" or open installed Spyder application from prompt with "spyder" and run main.py script out of Spyder for convenience

The user guide will be able to guide you through the application (doc/User Guide.docx). Have fun! :)
